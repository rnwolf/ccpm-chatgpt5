## Building a Network Schedule with Critical Chain Project Management (CCPM)

Critical Chain Project Management (CCPM) offers a powerful approach to project scheduling that addresses many limitations of traditional methods. Here's a detailed guide to building a network schedule using CCPM:

### 1. Create the Initial Project Network

- Identify all required project activities
- Determine dependencies between activities (finish-to-start, start-to-start, etc.)
- Create a network diagram showing these relationships
- Use realistic duration estimates for each activity (not padded estimates)

### 2. Identify Resource Requirements and Constraints

- Assign resources to each activity
- Identify potential resource conflicts where the same resource is needed for multiple activities at once
- Resolve resource conflicts by leveling or resequencing activities

### 3. Create the Critical Chain

- Identify the longest path through the network considering both task dependencies and resource constraints - this is your critical chain
- Unlike the traditional critical path, the critical chain accounts for resource availability
- The critical chain determines the project duration

### 4. Remove Hidden Safety from Task Estimates

- In traditional scheduling, team members often add safety buffers to individual tasks
- CCPM removes these hidden buffers from individual tasks
- Use 50% probability estimates (median time) rather than 90-95% probability estimates

### 5. Add Project Buffer

- Create a project buffer at the end of the critical chain
- The project buffer protects the project completion date from variability in critical chain tasks
- Typically sized at 50% of the total critical chain duration

### 6. Add Feeding Buffers

- Insert feeding buffers where non-critical chains merge into the critical chain
- These protect the critical chain from delays in non-critical paths
- Size feeding buffers at approximately 50% of the duration of the feeding chain

### 7. Implement Resource Buffers

- Add resource buffers (time or capacity) to ensure critical resources are available when needed
- Focus on critical chain resources to prevent delays

### 8. Establish a Buffer Management System

- Divide buffers into three zones (typically green 0-33%, yellow 34-67%, red 68-100%)
- Track buffer consumption relative to project progress
- Use buffer status to prioritize actions and resources

### 9. Implement Early Start Scheduling

- Unlike traditional early start scheduling, CCPM uses late start scheduling
- Activities start as late as possible, reducing work-in-progress and multitasking

### 10. Monitor and Manage the Project

- Focus on critical chain task completion
- Track buffer consumption to determine if corrective action is needed
- Regularly update the plan based on actual progress
- Prioritize work based on critical chain and buffer status

When implemented correctly, CCPM can significantly improve project delivery reliability while reducing overall project duration by eliminating ineffective safety padding and focusing team efforts on the most critical work.

## Resolving Resource Conflicts in CCPM

When building a CCPM schedule, resolving resource conflicts is a critical step that requires specific techniques:

### Resource Leveling in CCPM

Resource leveling in CCPM involves these specific actions:

1. **Identify Multi-Tasking Scenarios**: Find instances where resources are assigned to multiple concurrent tasks.
2. **Sequential Prioritization**: Arrange tasks in sequence rather than in parallel when they require the same resource. The critical chain tasks receive priority.
3. **Eliminate Resource Over-allocation**: Analyze resource histograms to identify periods where demand exceeds capacity, then reschedule activities accordingly.
4. **Focus on Relay Race Mentality**: Resources should focus on one task at a time until completion, then immediately move to the next highest priority task.
5. **Use Resource Dependency Links**: Create explicit "resource links" in your scheduling software to enforce the sequencing of tasks requiring the same resource.

### Resequencing Activities

Resequencing involves these specific steps:

1. **Delay Non-Critical Activities**: Postpone non-critical activities that create resource conflicts with critical chain tasks.
2. **Split Activities When Necessary**: Break longer activities into segments to allow critical work to proceed with minimal delay.
3. **Reallocate Resources**: Consider shifting specialized resources to critical work and assigning more generalized resources to non-critical work.

## Late Start Scheduling in CCPM

CCPM's late start scheduling approach fundamentally differs from traditional early start methods:

### Traditional Early Start Scheduling:

- Activities begin as soon as their predecessors are complete
- Creates large amounts of work-in-progress (WIP)
- Often leads to Student Syndrome (delaying work until deadlines approach)
- Results in frequent multitasking as multiple paths proceed simultaneously

### CCPM Late Start Scheduling:

1. **Reverse Pass Scheduling**: Calculate the late start and late finish dates for each activity by working backward from the project end date minus the project buffer.
2. **Just-in-Time Resource Allocation**: Resources are committed only when needed, not mobilized early.
3. **Reduced Work-in-Progress**: Fewer activities are active simultaneously, allowing focused attention on critical work.
4. **Roadrunner Mentality**: When a task is completed early, the successor task starts immediately, regardless of its scheduled start date (passing the baton in a relay race).
5. **Focused Execution**: Teams work on one task at a time until completion, then immediately move to the next task, eliminating multitasking inefficiencies.
6. **Buffer Management**: Project progress is measured by comparing the rate of buffer consumption against the rate of critical chain completion.

In practice, this late start approach helps maintain focus, reduces the impact of Parkinson's Law (work expanding to fill available time), and ensures resources are available when needed for critical chain activities.
